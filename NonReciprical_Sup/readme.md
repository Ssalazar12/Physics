# Movies for The supplementary material of "Robustness of travelling states in generic non-reciprocal
mixtures"

- movie1: Corresponds to a system with parameters $R_{in} = 22$, D0 = 0.01, œÅ = 0.1, VAA = 1.0, VBB = 0.0 . 
- R1_movie1: corresponds to Figure R1 in the predator prey regime delta=-1.5 for the case of Solid chasing Gas:  vaa=0.0 vbb=1.0 delta=-1.5
- R1_movie2:: corresponds to Figure R1 in the predator prey regime delta=-1.5 for the case of Solid chasing Solid: vaa=1.0 vbb=1.0 delta =-1.5
- R1_movie3: corresponds to Figure R1 in the predator prey regime delta=-1.5 for the case of Gas chasing Gas: vaa=0.0 vbb=0.0 delta =-1.4
- movie4: Shows the beahaviour of the system for different combinations of aggregate mixture states in periodic boundary conditions with delta = 0.9
