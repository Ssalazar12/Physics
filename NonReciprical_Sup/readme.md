# Movies for The supplementary material of "Robustness of travelling states in generic non-reciprocal mixtures"

- movie1: Corresponds to a system with parameters $R_{in} = 22$, $D_0 = 0.01$, $\rho = 0.1$, $V_{AA} = 1.0$, $V_{BB} = 0.0$ . 
- R1_movie1: Corresponds to Figure R1 in the predator prey regime $\delta =-1.5$ for the case of Solid chasing Gas:  $V_{AA}=0.0$, $V_{BB}=1.0$ .
- R1_movie2:: Corresponds to Figure R1 in the predator prey regime $\delta =-1.5$ for the case of Solid chasing Solid: $V_{AA}=1.0$, $V_{BB}=1.0$ .
- R1_movie3: Corresponds to Figure R1 in the predator prey regime $\delta =-1.5$ for the case of Gas chasing Gas: $V_{AA}=0.0$, $V_{BB}=0.0$ .
- movie4: Shows the behaviour of the system for different combinations of aggregate mixture states in periodic boundary conditions with $\delta = \pm 0.9$ .
- R6_movie1: Corresponds to a system in quasi 1-D,  with Periodic boundaries in the horizontal direction and fixed boundaries with size $L_0=15$ in the vertical direction. The paramenters are $\delta = 0.9$ and $D_0=0.01$
- R6_movie2: Corresponds to a system in quasi 1-D,  with Periodic boundaries in the horizontal direction and fixed boundaries with size $L_0=22$ in the vertical direction. The paramenters are $\delta = 0.9$ and $D_0=0.01$
- R6_movie3: Corresponds to a system in quasi 1-D,  with Periodic boundaries in the horizontal direction and fixed boundaries with size $L_0=35$ in the vertical direction. The paramenters are $\delta = 0.9$ and $D_0=0.01$
- R7_movie: Compares a system with annular confinement with is equivalent in quasi-1D.
